# Super Simple Template Language

The Super Simple Template Language tool wraps \<p\> tags around paragraphs. It's so simple that the language doesn't even exist yet!

## Motivation

I need a simple template language & html generator for my blog.

## Roadmap

 - Ability to encode metadata that is not parsed (for feeding into other tools)
 - \<a\> tags
 - \<code\> tags
